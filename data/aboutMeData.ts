  description: [
    "After spending over a decade working in IT Security, I decided to take a leap and follow my long-time passion — software and web development.",
    "For 10 years, I worked as an IT Security Engineer (Solutions Consultant) at Net++ Technology in Belgrade, Serbia, where I learned the ins and outs of systems, networks, and cybersecurity. Over time, as more tools moved to the cloud, I found myself increasingly fascinated by how applications are built — not just how to protect them. That curiosity quickly turned into a full-blown passion.",
    "In recent years, I’ve devoted myself to learning modern web technologies, completing online courses and academies, and working closely with an experienced mentor. I’ve also built several personal projects — some of which you can explore right here in my portfolio.",
    "Beyond coding, I love to plan, visualize, and build things — whether that’s a web app, a DIY setup, or something hands-on like a CNC or 3D printing project. I enjoy the process of turning an idea into something real and functional, whether it lives on a screen or on a workbench.",
    "I’m currently based in Belgium, where I continue to sharpen my coding skills while balancing the rewarding chaos of paternity life. I’m always eager to collaborate, learn from others, and take on challenges that push me forward as a developer and a creator.",
    "If you’d like to chat about web development, security, or creative problem-solving, feel free to reach out — I’d love to connect!",
